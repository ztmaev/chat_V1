## 🐳 Docker Setup

The Chat API can be easily deployed using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Quick Docker Start

```bash
# Start the API with Docker
./docker-start.sh start

# View logs
./docker-start.sh logs

# Stop the API
./docker-start.sh stop
```

### Docker Commands

```bash
# Start in production mode
./docker-start.sh start prod

# Rebuild after code changes
./docker-start.sh rebuild

# Backup database
./docker-start.sh backup

# Initialize with demo data
./docker-start.sh init

# View status
./docker-start.sh status

# Access container shell
./docker-start.sh shell
```

### Manual Docker Compose

```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f chat-api

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

### Docker Features

- ✅ Automated container setup with health checks
- ✅ Persistent database and uploads via volumes
- ✅ Environment-based configuration via .env file
- ✅ Resource limits and logging
- ✅ Easy backup and restore
- ✅ Isolated network for security

### Environment Configuration

The Docker setup uses a `.env` file for configuration. On first run, the startup script will create one from `.env.example` if it doesn't exist.

**Important:** Make sure to set `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file to avoid the warning message.

### Using Make Commands

```bash
make start      # Start API
make prod       # Start in production mode
make stop       # Stop API
make logs       # View logs
make test       # Run Docker tests
make backup     # Backup database
make help       # Show all commands
```

### Troubleshooting Docker

```bash
# Container won't start
./docker-start.sh logs

# Port 5001 in use
sudo lsof -i :5001

# Rebuild container
./docker-start.sh rebuild

# Run diagnostic tests
./test-docker-setup.sh
```

## 🔐 Authentication

All messaging endpoints require Firebase authentication.

### Client-Side (Frontend)

```typescript
import { auth } from '@/config/firebase';

// Get Firebase ID token
const user = auth.currentUser;
const idToken = await user.getIdToken();

// Include in API requests
fetch('http://localhost:5001/messages/threads', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${idToken}`,
  },
});
```

### Testing Authentication

```bash
# Get token from frontend, then:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     http://localhost:5001/auth/test
```

### Automatic User Profile Enrichment

When a user accesses the API for the first time (or if their role is missing), the system automatically:

1. **Fetches user role** from Hyptrb API: `GET https://api.hyptrb.africa/roles/{email}`
2. **Fetches profile data** based on role:
   - **Client**: `GET https://api.hyptrb.africa/clients/get/{email}` → Uses `businessName`
   - **Admin** (main_admin, billing_admin, campaign_admin): `GET https://api.hyptrb.africa/admin/profile/{email}` → Uses `name`
   - **Influencer**: `GET https://api.hyptrb.africa/influencer/get/profile/{uid}` → Uses `full_name`, `profile_picture_url`
3. **Updates database** with enriched profile information (display_name, role, photo_url, phone_number)
4. **Fetches campaigns** and auto-creates threads (for clients and influencers only):
   - **Client**: `GET https://api.hyptrb.africa/clients/get/all/campaigns/{email}` → Creates thread per campaign
   - **Influencer**: `GET https://api.hyptrb.africa/influencer/get/clients/collaborations/{uid}` → Creates thread per current campaign
5. **Conversations and messages** automatically use the stored avatar from database

This ensures users have proper display names, role information, and campaign-based threads without manual setup.

**Example Flow:**
```
User Login → Firebase Auth → API Request
                              ↓
                    Check local database
                              ↓
                    No role found? → Fetch from Hyptrb
                              ↓
                    GET /roles/{email}
                              ↓
                    role = "client"
                              ↓
                    GET /clients/get/{email}
                              ↓
                    Extract businessName & photo
                              ↓
                    GET /clients/get/all/campaigns/{email}
                              ↓
                    Create threads for each campaign
                    (one thread per campaign_id)
                              ↓
                    Update local database
                              ↓
                    Continue with request
```

**Graceful Fallback:**
- If Hyptrb API is unavailable, user is created with basic Firebase info
- Role can be updated later when API becomes available
- System logs warnings but doesn't block user access

**Testing:**
```bash
# Test Hyptrb integration
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 test_hyptrb_integration.py
```


## 📡 API Endpoints

### Admin Dashboard (Session-based Auth)
- `GET /` - Redirects to admin login
- `GET /admin/login` - Admin login page
- `POST /admin/login` - Submit login credentials
- `GET /admin/logout` - Logout and clear session
- `GET /admin/dashboard` - Main dashboard with system status (protected)
- `GET /admin/stats` - Database statistics page (protected)
- `GET /admin/docs` - API documentation page (protected)
- `GET /admin/api/stats` - JSON stats endpoint (protected)

**Admin Authentication:**
- Session-based authentication using Flask sessions
- Credentials stored in environment variables (`ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`)
- Persistent sessions with secure secret key
- Automatic redirect to login for unauthenticated access
- Beautiful modern UI with dark theme

### Authentication Test
- `GET /auth/test` - Verify authentication (requires token)
- `GET /health` - Health check (public)

### User Management
- `GET /users/me` - Get current user profile
- `GET /users` - List all users (paginated, limit/offset params)
- `GET /users/<firebase_uid>` - Get specific user by Firebase UID

**Note:** Users are automatically created/updated on any authenticated request.

### Threads
- `GET /messages/threads` - List all threads (owned by authenticated user)
- `GET /messages/threads/<thread_id>` - Get thread details (owner only)

**Automatic Thread Creation & Sync:**
- Threads are **automatically created** when users first access the API
- Threads are **automatically synced** every time `GET /messages/threads` is called
- Each campaign from Hyptrb gets its own thread
- **Clients**: One thread per campaign they created
- **Influencers**: One thread per campaign they're collaborating on
- **Admins** (main_admin, billing_admin, campaign_admin): No automatic threads (can join campaigns via API)
- Thread creation is idempotent (won't create duplicates)
- **Always up-to-date**: New campaigns in Hyptrb automatically appear as threads

**Thread Schema:**
- Each thread is linked to a Hyptrb `campaign_id`
- UNIQUE constraint: One thread per `(campaign_id, created_by)` combination
- Clients and influencers get separate threads for the same campaign
- Thread title: "Campaign: {campaign_name}"

### Conversations
- `GET /messages/threads/<thread_id>/conversations` - List conversations (owner only)
- `POST /messages/threads/<thread_id>/conversations` - Create conversation
- `POST /messages/threads/<thread_id>/conversations/<conversation_id>/join` - Join conversation as participant2
- `GET /messages/threads/<thread_id>/conversations/<conversation_id>` - Get messages
- `POST /messages/threads/<thread_id>/conversations/<conversation_id>` - Send message
- `PUT /messages/threads/<thread_id>/conversations/<conversation_id>` - Mark as read

**Conversation Creation:**
- Thread owner creates conversation (becomes `participant1`)
- `other_participant_id` is **optional** - can start conversation alone
- Thread owner can send messages immediately, even without participant2
- Names and avatars fetched from database automatically

**Joining Conversations:**
- Other users can join a conversation with `POST .../join`
- Only works if conversation has no `participant2` yet
- Joining user becomes `participant2`
- Cannot join your own conversation

### Admin Features (Admin Only)

#### POST /messages/campaigns/{campaign_id}/join
**Join a campaign thread as an admin**

- ⚠️ **Requires admin role** (`role='main_admin'`, `'billing_admin'`, or `'campaign_admin'` in database)
- **Purpose**: Allows admins to join any campaign thread for support/monitoring
- **Request Body**: None (campaign ID in URL path)
- **Authentication**: Firebase token in Authorization header

**How it works:**
- Finds the thread associated with the campaign_id
- Creates a conversation between admin and campaign owner
- Conversation named: "{Campaign Name} - Admin Support"
- Returns thread and conversation details for immediate messaging

**Security:**
- Only users with admin roles (`main_admin`, `billing_admin`, or `campaign_admin`) can access
- Admins cannot join their own campaigns
- Validates campaign thread exists

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "message": "Successfully joined campaign",
  "campaign_id": "68ba588b8500561576b8f3fd",
  "thread_id": "t12345abc",
  "conversation": {
    "id": "c67890def",
    "name": "Campaign Name - Admin Support",
    "participant1_id": "owner_uid",
    "participant2_id": "admin_uid"
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `403 Forbidden` - User is not an admin
- `404 Not Found` - Campaign thread not found
- `400 Bad Request` - Trying to join own campaign

#### POST /messages/admin/chat/{user_firebase_uid}
**Start a direct chat with any user as an admin**

- ⚠️ **Requires admin role** (`role='main_admin'`, `'billing_admin'`, or `'campaign_admin'` in database)
- **Purpose**: Start a direct support chat with any user by their Firebase UID
- **Request Body**: None (user Firebase UID in URL path)
- **Authentication**: Firebase token in Authorization header

**How it works:**
- Validates target user exists in database
- Creates a dedicated admin support thread (campaign_id: `admin_support_{user_uid}`)
- Creates conversation between admin and user
- Thread named: "Admin Support - {User Name}"
- Idempotent - returns existing chat if already started

**Security:**
- Only users with admin roles (`main_admin`, `billing_admin`, or `campaign_admin`) can access
- Admins cannot chat with themselves
- Validates target user exists

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "message": "Admin chat started successfully",
  "user_firebase_uid": "user123abc",
  "thread_id": "t98765xyz",
  "thread": {
    "id": "t98765xyz",
    "title": "Admin Support - John Doe",
    "campaign_id": "admin_support_user123abc"
  },
  "conversation": {
    "id": "c54321def",
    "name": "Admin Support - John Doe",
    "participant1_id": "admin_uid",
    "participant2_id": "user123abc"
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `403 Forbidden` - User is not an admin (must have main_admin, billing_admin, or campaign_admin role)
- `404 Not Found` - Target user not found
- `400 Bad Request` - Trying to chat with yourself

## 🗄️ Database Structure

### Tables

**users**
- Stores Firebase user information
- Primary key: `firebase_uid`
- Fields: email, display_name, photo_url, role, phone_number, email_verified, last_seen
- Automatically populated from Firebase Auth on any API request

**threads**
- Campaign-based message organization (auto-created from Hyptrb)
- Fields: id, title, description, `campaign_id`, `created_by`, status, timestamps
- **Campaign Link:** Each thread is linked to a Hyptrb campaign via `campaign_id`
- **Ownership:** Each thread has one owner (the client or influencer)
- **Uniqueness:** UNIQUE(campaign_id, created_by) - one thread per campaign per user
- **Access Control:** Only thread owners can view and manage their threads
- **Automatic:** Created on first API access for clients and influencers

**conversations**
- Chats within threads (1 or 2 participants)
- `participant1_id` (required) - Usually the thread owner who created the conversation
- `participant2_id` (optional) - Can be NULL, added later via join endpoint
- Tracks last message, unread count, participant names and avatars
- **Solo start:** Conversations can be created with only participant1
- **Join later:** participant2 can join via `/join` endpoint
- **Access Control:** Users can only see conversations they're participants in

**messages**
- Individual messages
- Supports text, files, or both
- Soft delete capability
- Attachment metadata with dimensions

### Triggers

- Auto-update conversation last_message
- Auto-update conversation timestamps
- Handle deleted message updates

### Indexes

- Performance optimization on frequently queried fields
- Foreign key relationships

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Access Control (Updated 2025-10-11)

**✅ FIXED: Conversation Access Control Vulnerability**

Previously, users could view all conversations in a thread regardless of participation. This has been fixed:

- **Database Layer:** `get_conversations_by_thread()` now filters by `user_id`
- **SQL Filtering:** `WHERE (participant1_id = ? OR participant2_id = ?)`
- **API Layer:** All conversation endpoints now pass authenticated user's ID
- **Message Access:** Added verification that user is a participant before allowing message operations
- **HTTP Status:** Returns `403 Forbidden` for unauthorized access attempts

**Security Rules:**
1. ✅ Users can ONLY see conversations where they are participant1 or participant2
2. ✅ Users can ONLY read messages from their own conversations
3. ✅ Users can ONLY send messages to their own conversations
4. ✅ Database-level filtering (efficient and secure)
5. ✅ No sensitive data ever loaded into memory for unauthorized users

**Testing Access Control:**
```bash
# User A creates conversation with User C
# User B tries to fetch conversations - should NOT see User A's conversation
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <user-b-token>" \
     http://localhost:5001/messages/threads/thread_1/conversations

# User B tries to access User A's conversation directly - should get 403
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <user-b-token>" \
     http://localhost:5001/messages/threads/thread_1/conversations/conv_1/messages
```

### Development
- ✅ Never commit `serviceAccountKey.json`
- ✅ Use `.env` for configuration
- ✅ Test with real Firebase tokens
- ✅ Verify token expiration handling
- ✅ Test access control with multiple user accounts

### Production
- ✅ Use environment variables for credentials
- ✅ Enable HTTPS only
- ✅ Restrict CORS origins
- ✅ Implement rate limiting
- ✅ Monitor authentication logs
- ✅ Rotate service account keys periodically
- ✅ Set proper file permissions (600 for keys)
- ✅ Audit access control logs for 403 errors

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Recommendations

### 🔴 Critical Issues

#### 1. File Upload Security
**Issue:** All file types are currently allowed (`ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = None`), including executables.
```python
# Current: app.py line 52
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = None  # Allow all file types
```
**Risk:** Malicious file uploads, potential code execution
**Recommendation:**
```python
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif', 'pdf', 'doc', 'docx', 'mp4', 'mov', 'webm'}
```

#### 2. No Rate Limiting
**Issue:** No rate limiting on any endpoint
**Risk:** DoS attacks, brute force attempts, resource exhaustion
**Recommendation:** Implement Flask-Limiter
```python
from flask_limiter import Limiter
limiter = Limiter(app, key_func=lambda: request.headers.get('Authorization'))
```

#### 3. Inefficient Thread Sync
**Issue:** `GET /messages/threads` fetches ALL campaigns from HypTrb API on every request
**Impact:** Slow response times, unnecessary API calls, poor performance
**Current behavior:**
- Every thread list request triggers full campaign sync
- For influencers, fetches all pages of jobs
- Caught by UNIQUE constraint (inefficient)

**Recommendation:** Move to background job (Celery) or add caching with TTL

#### 4. Missing Message Pagination
**Issue:** `GET /messages/threads/<thread_id>/conversations/<conversation_id>` loads ALL messages
**Impact:** Slow for long conversations, high memory usage
**Recommendation:** Add pagination with limit/offset parameters

### 🟡 High Priority Issues

#### 5. Unread Count Not Incremented
**Issue:** Database triggers update `last_message` but don't increment `unread_count`
**Impact:** Unread counts remain at 0
**Recommendation:** Add trigger to increment unread_count on message insert

#### 6. No Input Validation
**Issue:** No validation for:
- Thread titles/descriptions length
- Message content length
- Email format
- User-provided names

**Recommendation:** Add Pydantic models or marshmallow schemas

#### 7. Authentication Tokens Logged
**Issue:** Tokens logged to console in `firebase_auth.py:73`
```python
print(f"   Token preview: {id_token[:50]}...")
```
**Risk:** Token exposure if logs are compromised
**Recommendation:** Remove token logging, log only metadata

#### 8. No Database Connection Pooling
**Issue:** New SQLite connection created for every operation
**Impact:** Inefficient under load, potential "too many connections" errors
**Recommendation:** Use connection pooling or migrate to PostgreSQL for production

### 🟠 Medium Priority Issues

#### 9. No CSRF Protection
**Issue:** Admin routes use session-based auth without CSRF tokens
**Recommendation:** Add Flask-WTF CSRF protection

#### 10. Hardcoded Configuration
**Issue:** `HYPTRB_BASE_URL` hardcoded in `hyptrb_api.py`
**Recommendation:** Move to environment variable

#### 11. No API Versioning
**Issue:** No version prefix (e.g., `/api/v1/`)
**Impact:** Breaking changes will affect all clients
**Recommendation:** Add version prefix to all routes

#### 12. Missing Request Timeout Retry Logic
**Issue:** HypTrb API calls have 10s timeout but no retry logic
**Recommendation:** Add exponential backoff and circuit breaker pattern

### 📊 Performance Improvements

#### 13. N+1 Query Problem
**Location:** Thread enrichment loops fetch last message for each conversation separately
**Recommendation:** Use JOIN or bulk fetch

#### 14. No Caching Layer
**Missing cache for:**
- User profiles (fetched from HypTrb on every request)
- Thread lists
- Campaign data

**Recommendation:** Implement Redis with TTL

#### 15. Duplicate Code
**Issue:** Conversation enrichment logic duplicated in multiple endpoints
**Recommendation:** Extract to helper function

### 🔒 Security Recommendations

- [ ] Add Content-Security-Policy headers

- [ ] Add error tracking (Sentry or similar)
- [ ] Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Firebase Not Initializing

**Problem:** `⚠️ WARNING: No Firebase credentials found`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify file exists
ls -la serviceAccountKey.json

# Check permissions
chmod 600 serviceAccountKey.json

# Set environment variable
export FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY="serviceAccountKey.json"
```

### Authentication Failing

**Problem:** All requests return 401

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Firebase project ID matches frontend/backend
2. Check user is signed in on frontend
3. Verify token is in Authorization header
4. Check token hasn't expired (refresh after 1 hour)

### Database Issues

**Problem:** Database errors or missing tables

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reinitialize database
rm messaging.db
python3 setup_demo_data.py
```

## 📦 Dependencies

```
Flask==2.3.3              # Web framework
Flask-CORS==4.0.0         # CORS support
firebase-admin==6.2.0     # Firebase authentication
Pillow==10.0.1            # Image processing
opencv-python==4.8.1.78   # Video processing

## 🔄 Migration from Unsecured API

If you have an existing unsecured version:

1. **Backup current version:**
   ```bash
   cp app.py app_insecure.py.bak
   ```

2. **Current version is already secured** - `app.py` now uses Firebase auth


4. **Test thoroughly** before removing backup

### High Priority
5. 🟡 **Fix unread count** - Add trigger to increment on new messages
6. 🟡 **Add input validation** - Validate all user inputs
7. 🟡 **Remove token logging** - Security risk in production
8. 🟡 **Add connection pooling** - Or migrate to PostgreSQL

### Medium Priority
9. 🟠 **Add CSRF protection** - For admin routes
10. 🟠 **Implement caching** - Redis for user profiles and threads
11. 🟠 **Add API versioning** - Prepare for breaking changes
12. 🟠 **Proper error logging** - Replace print statements with logging module

- ✅ Old users get threads automatically synced when they call the endpoint
- ✅ New campaigns in Hyptrb automatically appear as threads
- ✅ Added `campaign_id` field to threads table
- ✅ UNIQUE constraint on (campaign_id, created_by) - prevents duplicate threads
- ✅ Client threads: Auto-created from all campaigns owned by client
- ✅ Influencer threads: Auto-created from current collaborations
- ✅ Idempotent thread creation - safe to run multiple times

- ✅ Simplified conversation creation - only requires `other_participant_id`
- ✅ GET /messages/threads now filters by authenticated user
- ✅ Added 403 Forbidden responses for unauthorized thread access
- ✅ Backward compatibility with `participant2_id` parameter

**Workflow Changes:**
- Creating a thread: User becomes the owner automatically
- Creating a conversation: Thread owner is participant1, request only needs other participant
- Accessing threads: Only owners can access their threads
- Conversations: Thread owner is always included
